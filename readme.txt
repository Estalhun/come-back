Send rearrangement emails to inactive customers. Bring them back.

== Description ==

Come Back! sends an automatic email notification to inactive customers to bring your **LOST** customers back. Inactivity is based on logging in.

Create special re-engagement emails targeted directly at your “inactive” customers. Customer inactivity is a fact of life. How you handle it makes all the difference.

**Sample Email:**

*We haven't seen you in a while. Things are a lot different since the last time you logged into {site_name}. I'm {name}, CEO of {site_name}. I wanted to send you a note since you have been inactive for a while. You can come back and continue your awesome works at {site_name}.*
